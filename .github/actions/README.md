# Claude CI Composite Actions

Reusable Tier-1 Claude CI actions for MegaETH repositories.

## Actions

- `.github/actions/claude-interactive` - interactive `@claude` handling.
- `.github/actions/claude-pr-review` - pull request review.
- `.github/actions/claude-label-check` - pull request label validation.
- `.github/actions/claude-issue-triage` - newly opened issue triage.

## Inputs

All actions accept:

- `claude_code_oauth_token` - required. Pass `${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}`.
- `allowed_bots` - optional, defaults to `mega-putin`.
- `extra_allowed_tools` - optional, appended to the canonical `--allowedTools` list. Rust repos can pass `Bash(cargo:*)` here.

Prompt-bearing actions (`pr-review`, `label-check`, and `issue-triage`) also accept:

- `extra_prompt` - optional, appended after a blank line for per-repo prompt deltas.

The `interactive` action does not accept `extra_prompt` because `@claude` is native.

The `pr-review` action additionally accepts:

- `github_identity_token` - optional, defaults to empty.
  When supplied, this token is the single identity for creating reviews,
  posting or updating status comments, and resolving addressed automated
  review threads.
  When omitted, publication uses the job token and leaves GitHub thread state
  unchanged.
- `model` - optional, defaults to `claude-opus-4-7`.
  This strong model handles initial, high-risk, and explicitly deep reviews.
- `incremental_model` - optional, defaults to empty, which uses the Claude Code default
  (Sonnet class).
  It handles low-risk incremental reviews.
- `review_depth` - optional, defaults to `standard`.
  Set it to `deep` to make the semantic-analysis stage fan out relevant review dimensions
  and adversarially verify the candidates before returning one structured result.
- `premortem` - optional, defaults to `auto`.
  Automatic mode runs the independent production-failure analysis for initial and high-risk
  reviews, but skips it for ordinary incremental updates.
  `on` always enables it and `off` disables it.

The semantic-analysis stage runs under a turn budget: 12 for a low-risk incremental review,
36 for a strong-tier one, and 56 for `deep`.
Roughly ten turns go on mandated context — six pipeline files plus repo guidance — before the
diff is read, and a small diff inside a large file spends many more paging through it, so the
budget tracks files to understand rather than lines changed.
The retry gets half again as many turns as the first attempt, because exhausting the budget is
deterministic and replaying it with the same budget cannot succeed.

Consumers that already create a GitHub App token can opt into the unified identity with:

```yaml
with:
  github_identity_token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
```

The semantic stage is bounded to 12 turns for fast incremental reviews, 24 for standard
full or high-risk reviews, and 40 for explicit deep reviews.

### PR review pipeline

The PR reviewer is an explicit staged pipeline:

1. A deterministic preparation step freezes the base and head SHAs, loads the durable review
   manifest, fetches prior automated threads, computes the full or incremental diff, and
   selects the model tier. It then posts or updates the sticky status comment to
   `🔄 Review in progress`, so the PR shows the round has started instead of staying silent
   until the review lands minutes later.
2. Claude performs semantic analysis and verification with read-only tools.
   It returns schema-constrained data and cannot publish comments or resolve threads.
3. A deterministic compiler validates findings, enforces severity budgets, checks RIGHT-side
   anchors, formats the standard human-facing messages, and suppresses internal review
   machinery.
4. A deterministic publisher rechecks the live head, submits at most one review, optionally
   resolves addressed automated threads, and updates one sticky status comment.

The sticky comment contains a hidden, versioned manifest with the last published head,
reviewer and rubric versions, stable finding IDs, thread IDs, and finding dispositions.
Later runs use that manifest as a checkpoint and fall back to GitHub review history if the
manifest is unavailable.
The manifest never contains complete diffs, PR prose, tool output, secrets, or Claude session
transcripts.
Inline findings are linked back to the exact published review and comment IDs, with bounded
retries for GitHub API propagation.
When `github_identity_token` is configured, the publisher does not mark a GitHub thread
resolved unless GitHub confirms the resolution mutation.
The configured identity is stored in the review manifest while historical `claude` and
`github-actions` state remains readable for migration.

The action performs a full review when there is no valid checkpoint, the previous head is not
an ancestor, or the pipeline or rubric version changed.
Otherwise it reviews only the delta since the last published head and rechecks open findings.
It discards output if the PR head changes during analysis.

Internal production-failure analysis is never named in GitHub review output.
Confirmed issues become ordinary findings.
Useful uncertainty becomes an `Open question` with medium or low confidence and a concrete
verification request.
Rejected candidates and an empty internal analysis remain invisible.

Open questions have the same durable lifecycle as findings.
Each one gets a stable ID and a hidden marker on its status line, and the manifest records
which review asked it.
A later round dispositions every open question as `open`, `answered`, or `withdrawn`, and the
publisher edits the original review body in place so the question line reads
`✅ **Answered**` or `🚫 **Withdrawn**` with a one-line reason.
Editing a submitted review body creates no new review and no new notification, and rewriting
reproduces the same marker line, so the update is idempotent and retried on the next round if
GitHub rejects it.
A question that is already open is never re-asked; the original stays the copy the author
answers.

## Per-Repo Conventions

The prompt-bearing actions instruct Claude to read and respect a consumer repo's own agent
instruction files when they exist (`REVIEW.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and any
other repo-level agent guidance), with those per-repo rules taking precedence over the
canonical inline prompt. Use these files for repo-specific rules; reserve `extra_prompt` for
small deltas that do not belong in a checked-in convention file.

`pr-review` tags every inline finding with a bold severity label (`**[Critical]**`,
`**[Major]**`, `**[Minor]**`, or `**[Nit]**`).
Clean reviews and re-reviews update the sticky status without creating another review
notification.
Rounds with findings or new open questions submit one atomic review and update the same sticky
status.
The sticky status comment states up front that it is a living comment rewritten in place on
every run, so a reader who meets it mid-thread can tell it describes the current head rather
than the moment it first appeared.
It carries the reviewed range, an update timestamp, this round's counts, and a roll-up of the
questions still awaiting an answer with a link to the review that asked each one.
It moves through three phases: `🔄 Review in progress` from preparation, then either the
finished verdict or `🛠️ Review did not finish` for a round that ends without publishing.
Every non-publishing path — a failure, a discarded stale head — retires the in-progress phase
itself, so the comment never sits at "in progress" after the job ends. A skip-mode round
publishes nothing and is never announced.
When old automated review threads are addressed, the deterministic publisher resolves them
without adding confirmation replies.
A consumer repo's `REVIEW.md` may override or extend the semantic severity guidance.

## Consumer Requirements

Consumer jobs should pin these actions to `@main`. A merge to `documentation` `main` goes live
for every consumer automatically, with no consumer workflow edits required.
Use `megaeth-labs/documentation/.github/actions/claude-interactive@main`,
`megaeth-labs/documentation/.github/actions/claude-pr-review@main`,
`megaeth-labs/documentation/.github/actions/claude-label-check@main`, or
`megaeth-labs/documentation/.github/actions/claude-issue-triage@main`.

Documentation dogfoods these actions through the local `./.github/actions/claude-<name>` path, so every
PR to documentation smoke-tests them before merge.

Consumer jobs must run `actions/checkout` before these actions. They must also provide the
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret and set role-appropriate job permissions:

- `claude-interactive`: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`, `id-token: write`, `actions: read`
- `claude-pr-review`: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, `id-token: write`, `actions: read`
- `claude-label-check`: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, `id-token: write`
- `claude-issue-triage`: `contents: read`, `issues: write`, `id-token: write`

Before consumer repositories can reference these private actions, maintainers must enable
Settings -> Actions -> General -> Access -> "Accessible from repositories in the megaeth-labs organization".

## Example

```yaml
jobs:
  pr-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
          fetch-depth: 1

      - uses: megaeth-labs/documentation/.github/actions/claude-pr-review@main
        with:
          claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
          extra_allowed_tools: "Bash(cargo:*)"
          extra_prompt: |
            Add repository-specific review instructions here.
```

> Note: a PR that _modifies the calling repo's own_ `claude.yml` skips the `pr-review`
> job.
> `claude-code-action` validates that workflow against the default branch before it exchanges
> its app token, so self-modifying PRs cannot run the review step safely.
> This only affects the repo that changed its own workflow.
> It does not affect consumers pinned to `@main` in normal operation.

## Concurrency (pr-review)

Consumers should give the `pr-review` job a `timeout-minutes` value of at least `25` plus a
job-level concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress: true`.
The publisher revalidates the live PR base and head immediately before each GitHub mutation,
and review submissions are pinned to the frozen head commit. If either revision changes,
publication stops without advancing the manifest.
Latest-only cancellation avoids spending review time on queued, obsolete heads:

```yaml
pr-review:
  timeout-minutes: 25
  concurrency:
    group: claude-pr-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
```
